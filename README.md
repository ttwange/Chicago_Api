# Chicago Crimes API Data Pipeline Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Chicago Crimes API data pipeline developed using Mage AI. This pipeline extracts data from the [Chicago Crimes API](https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/xguy-4ndq.csv), processes it, and exports it to Google Cloud Storage. The pipeline is designed to automate the data retrieval and storage process, making it easier to work with the data for analysis or further processing.
